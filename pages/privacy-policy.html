          <p><em>Last updated: September 6, 2025</em></p>

          <p>
            At <strong>TradeRisk Calculator</strong> (“we”, “our”, “us”), your privacy matters. This Privacy Policy explains
            what information we collect, how we use it, and the choices you have. By using our website and tools,

            <li><strong>Local storage:</strong> We may store calculator preferences (e.g., theme, risk defaults) in your browser’s local storage on your device only.</li>
          </ul>

            <li>To communicate with you when you contact us.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>3. Cookies & Local Storage</h3>
          <p>
            Our tool primarily uses <strong>local storage</strong> to remember preferences on your device.
            We keep cookie usage to a minimum and do not use cookies for advertising or profiling.
          </p>

          <h3>4. Data Sharing</h3>
          <p>
            We <strong>do not sell</strong> your personal information. We do not share personal data with third parties

          <h3>5. Data Security</h3>
          <p>
            We take reasonable technical and organizational measures to protect information. No method of transmission or storage is 100% secure, so we cannot guarantee absolute security.
